# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data
This project is the first project of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree course and is about creating a neural network to predict bike sharing rides based on [the bike sharing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) from UCI Machine learning Database.
## Getting started
